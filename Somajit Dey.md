### Current goals

Right now I am seeking a Post Doctoral position/fellowship in Theoretical/Computational Physics or the rather nascent interdisciplinary fields where physicists can contribute meaningfully.

### Research interests

My interests are wide. Here are a few of them:

- Modelling and simulating lyotropic liquid crystals. (Worked on this)
- Developing more efficient integrators for large scale molecular dynamics simulations. (Worked on this)
- Lipid or copolymer based nanoparticles for cellular delivery of therapeutics. (Worked on this)
- Open and non-equilibrium systems - spontaneous emergence of organized structures without violating the 2nd law. Origin of Life.
- Complex systems; Collective dynamics, self-organization, emergence and universality, as found in biological and ecological systems.
- General models for the phenomena of jamming in different systems.
- Computational research on the physical chemistry of proteins.
- Quantum biology.
- The postulates of special relativity. (Worked on this)
- Tilted smectic phase in thermotropic liquid crystals. (Worked on this)

### Experience

- 5 years of successful (in terms of publication in esteemed peer-reviewed journals), self-motivated research in highly efficient modelling and simulation of complex systems with applications in academia, medicine, industry and education (see [Research papers](./research.html)).
- Successful, solo (single-authored) research in topics such as special relativity and computational methodology (see [Research papers](./research.html)).
- Corresponding author in all research publications till date.
- Conceived of, developed and actively maintaining many well-accepted free and open-source projects spanning a wide range - from decentralized chat apps and remote shells, to command-line utilities and various useful libraries (see [Software Projects](./foss.html)).
- Contributed to popular open-source projects maintained by others.
- Taught Physics to final year high school students for 3 years.

### Attitude

My training in Physics, and my experiences in software development, I believe, have made me a problem-solver at heart. Every work I do, be it my Physics research or FOSS projects, I religiously strive for these :

- Clarity
- Originality and Novelty 
- Efficiency and Minimalism
- Enhancement / Expansion / Broadening of scope
- Informing / Guiding / Inspiring future works

I love the world of ideas and it gives me goosebumps every time a beautiful idea could be materialized into tangible reality at the end of a research or software project. And that is why, I am always open to ideas as well.

Am a big fan of egoless programming, and I consciously make an effort to be as tolerant and inclusive as humanly possible. I derive great joy from technical discussions and communications with kindred spirits and the community at large. Working with a multicultural, interdisciplinary team would be an awesome experience to learn and give that I am looking forward to.

I am mostly self-taught, self-driven and self-motivated and thus, have an independent spirit - I like to do and try things myself rather than always requiring someone else to push or guide. I like to play at work using heuristic techniques that allow me to learn and adapt rapidly. I am quick to admit my mistakes and get on with a better idea / technique that I may come across. And I am not afraid to fail, but I can never accept not even trying merely because of a lack of confidence.
